The Simon game is an electronic memory game that challenges players to repeat sequences of lights and sounds in the correct order. Each round adds an additional step to the sequence, testing the player's ability to remember and replicate longer patterns. 
Hereâ€™s how the Simon game works:

1) Start the Game: Press any key on the keyboard to begin.
2) First Level: A color will blink. Click that color to proceed.
3) Next Levels: For each new level, remember the sequence from the previous level and click the colors in the correct order, adding the new color at the end.
4) Game Over: If you press the wrong button, the game ends. Have fun testing your memory!
